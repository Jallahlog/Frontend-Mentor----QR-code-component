### Links

## My process

Made the structure, then styled it. Not really much to say about.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow ? I dont really know tbh
- Google Fonts

### What I learned

Learned media queries :
```css
@media (max-width: 758px) {
    #square {
        width:90%;
    }
}
```
Learned about rem, vmax units. Kinda some things about flexbox too.

### Continued development

Responsive web-design. I feel like this is really poor, as it scales only starting from a starting breakdown of px.
